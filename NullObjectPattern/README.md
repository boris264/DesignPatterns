# Null Object Pattern

The intent of this pattern is to reduce the need to add checks and special behavior for handling null instances of certain variables that tend to propagate through applications. Rather, identify the behavior that should occur when a null is encountered, encapsulate this behavior into an instance of the type in question, and define this instance as a special, constant value of that type.
